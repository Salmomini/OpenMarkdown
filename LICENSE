1. Grant of Permission

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation (the “Software”), to use the
Software for any purpose, including personal, educational, and commercial use.

This permission includes the rights to:

- Use, study, and modify the Software
- Distribute the Software
- Create derivative works based on the Software
- Re-implement the OpenMarkdown parser for private, internal, or public use
- Create alternative implementations of the OpenMarkdown specification


2. Definition of Features

For the purposes of this license and the OpenMarkdown specification, a
“feature” is any behavior, syntax, or output explicitly described in the
official OpenMarkdown specification for a declared version.

Behavior that exists solely due to implementation bugs, undefined behavior,
unspecified edge cases, or deviations from the specification in the reference
parser does NOT constitute a feature, even if such behavior is observable in
current or past versions of the reference parser.


3. Alternative Implementations

You may create and distribute alternative implementations of the
OpenMarkdown parser.

An implementation may be described or represented as
“OpenMarkdown-compatible” only if it:

- Implements the parsing rules and semantic meaning defined in the
  OpenMarkdown specification for the declared version
- Fully supports all features defined for that version
- Does not implement, accept, or rely on features outside that version
- Produces results consistent with the OpenMarkdown specification,
  excluding behavior resulting from bugs or undefined behavior

Implementations that do not meet all of the above requirements must not be
represented as OpenMarkdown or OpenMarkdown-compatible.


4. Rendering, Output, and Styling

Alternative implementations may freely modify or replace:

- Rendering logic
- Output formats
- Themes or visual presentation
- Styling mechanisms, including custom CSS

Provided that:

- All features defined by the declared OpenMarkdown version are fully
  supported
- Rendering differences do not alter the parsed structure, semantics, or
  meaning of OpenMarkdown documents
- No defined feature is disabled, weakened, or made inaccessible due to
  rendering or styling choices


5. Restrictions on Representation

You may not:

- Represent a non-conforming implementation as OpenMarkdown or
  OpenMarkdown-compatible
- Claim or imply that an alternative implementation is official,
  endorsed, or authoritative
- Claim authorship, ownership, or control of the OpenMarkdown
  specification or reference parser

The OpenMarkdown specification and reference parser published by the
OpenMarkdown project remain the sole authoritative definitions of
OpenMarkdown.


6. Use of the Name “OpenMarkdown”

The name “OpenMarkdown”, including version identifiers such as
“OpenMarkdown v1”, may be used only to describe software or documents that
conform to the OpenMarkdown specification for the declared version.

Non-conforming software or documents must not be described as OpenMarkdown
or OpenMarkdown-compatible, but may describe themselves using other
terminology.

This section governs representation and naming only and does not restrict
the use, modification, or distribution of the Software itself.


7. Bug Compatibility

The OpenMarkdown project does not guarantee that behavior resulting from
bugs, undefined behavior, or unspecified edge cases will be preserved
between versions.

Such behavior may change or be removed at any time and does not create
compatibility requirements.

IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHOR OR COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM,
DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR
