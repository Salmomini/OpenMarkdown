1. Grant of Permission

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation (the “Software”), to use the
Software for any purpose, including personal, educational, and commercial use.

You may:
- Study the Software
- Modify the Software
- Re-implement the OpenMarkdown parser for private, internal, or public use
- Create alternative implementations of the OpenMarkdown specification


2. Alternative Implementations

You may create and distribute alternative implementations of the OpenMarkdown
parser only under the following conditions.

An alternative implementation may be described as “OpenMarkdown-compatible”
only if it:

- Fully implements all features defined for the declared OpenMarkdown version
- Does not implement, accept, or rely on any features not defined for that version
- Produces output equivalent to the OpenMarkdown reference parser for all valid
  inputs of that version

Any implementation that does not meet all of the above requirements is not
OpenMarkdown-compatible.


3. Restrictions on Representation

You may NOT:

- Represent a non-conforming implementation as OpenMarkdown or
  OpenMarkdown-compatible
- Claim or imply that an alternative implementation is official, endorsed, or
  authoritative
- Claim authorship, ownership, or control of the OpenMarkdown specification or
  reference parser

The OpenMarkdown specification and reference parser published by the
OpenMarkdown project remain the sole authoritative definitions of OpenMarkdown.


4. Use of the Name “OpenMarkdown”

The name “OpenMarkdown”, including version identifiers such as “OpenMarkdown v1”,
may be used only to describe software or documents that fully and exclusively
conform to the OpenMarkdown specification for the declared version.

A software implementation or document is considered OpenMarkdown-conformant
only if it:

- Implements all features defined for the declared OpenMarkdown version
- Does not implement, accept, or rely on any features outside that version
- Produces equivalent results to the OpenMarkdown reference parser for all valid
  inputs of that version

Non-conforming software or documents may not be described as OpenMarkdown or
OpenMarkdown-compatible.
