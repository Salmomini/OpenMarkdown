# OpenMarkdown

**OpenMarkdown:** the Markdown we were promised.

---

Tired of having to juggle five different Markdown flavors?  
And every time you send someone a document, you have to add:

> “Here is my file — it’s GitHub-flavored Markdown with LaTeX and Mermaid support, including inline HTML5!”

Yeah. Same.

That frustration is exactly why I made **OpenMarkdown**.  
*(Trust me — if something has annoyed you about Markdown, it has probably annoyed me too.)*

I’m a student, and I *love* Markdown for writing fast and efficiently.  
But over time, more and more things started to *seriously* annoy me:
different flavors, unclear rules, broken rendering, and the constant question of  
*“Will this even work on their machine?”*

So I built **OpenMarkdown** to fix that.

OpenMarkdown is versioned.  
Each version has **one single, official syntax** and **one authoritative parser**.
No flavors. No guesswork. No surprises. (Except you asking yourself why you didn’t find this earlier 👍)

**TL;DR:**  
*If your file works today, it will work forever.*

Each version defines a fixed set of features and parsing rules. Once released,
a version’s parser remains **stable, deterministic, and unchanged**. Documents
explicitly declare the version they target, ensuring that a file written for v1
is always parsed by a v1-compatible engine and renders the same way on every
machine, now and in the future.

The goal of OpenMarkdown is to make Markdown more stable and standardized within
a single, versioned specification and an authoritative reference parser.
