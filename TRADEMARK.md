# OpenMarkdown Name, Trademark, and Specification Policy

## 1. Purpose

The name **OpenMarkdown** identifies the official OpenMarkdown specification
and reference implementation maintained by Leon D.

This document exists to prevent confusion in the ecosystem while encouraging
open use, experimentation, and extension.

---

## 2. Use of the Name “OpenMarkdown”

You may use the name **OpenMarkdown** ONLY if:

- Your software follows the official OpenMarkdown specification
  for the declared version, AND
- Your implementation produces compatible output for that version.

If your software is modified, extended, experimental, or incompatible,
you MUST use a different name.

Examples:
- ✅ “OpenMarkdown Parser (v1.0 compatible)”
- ❌ “OpenMarkdown++”
- ❌ “Better OpenMarkdown”

---

## 3. Forks and Derivative Works

Forks and derivative works are welcome.

However:
- You may not represent modified or extended versions as official
  OpenMarkdown implementations.
- You must clearly indicate when your project is based on OpenMarkdown.

Acceptable phrasing:
- “Based on OpenMarkdown”
- “Derived from OpenMarkdown”

---

## 4. Specification Authority

The OpenMarkdown specification is defined by the official OpenMarkdown
repository and its tagged releases.

No fork or derivative work may claim to define or control the
OpenMarkdown specification.

---

## 5. Relationship to the MIT License

The OpenMarkdown reference implementation is licensed under the MIT License.

This policy does NOT restrict:
- Use of the source code
- Reimplementation of the specification
- Commercial use

It applies ONLY to the use of the name “OpenMarkdown” and claims of
compatibility or official status.
