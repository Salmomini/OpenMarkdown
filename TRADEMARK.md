# OpenMarkdown Name, Trademark, and Specification Policy

## 1. Purpose

The name **OpenMarkdown** identifies the official OpenMarkdown specification,
reference implementation, and default visual presentation maintained by Leon D.

This document exists to prevent confusion in the ecosystem while encouraging
open use, experimentation, and extension.


## 2. Use of the Name “OpenMarkdown”

You may use the name **OpenMarkdown** ONLY if:

- Your software follows the official OpenMarkdown specification
  for the declared version, AND
- Your implementation produces compatible output for that version.

If your software is modified, extended, experimental, or incompatible,
you MUST use a different name.

Examples:
- ✅ “OpenMarkdown Parser (v1.0 compatible)”
- ❌ “OpenMarkdown++”
- ❌ “Better OpenMarkdown”


## 3. Forks and Derivative Works

Forks and derivative works are welcome.

However:
- You may not represent modified or extended versions as official
  OpenMarkdown implementations.
- You must clearly indicate when your project is based on OpenMarkdown.

Acceptable phrasing:
- “Based on OpenMarkdown”
- “Derived from OpenMarkdown”


## 4. Specification Authority

The OpenMarkdown specification is defined by the official OpenMarkdown
repository and its tagged releases.

No fork or derivative work may claim to define or control the
OpenMarkdown specification.


## 5. OpenMarkdown Visual Identity and Theme

OpenMarkdown includes a default visual theme that defines the official
OpenMarkdown look and presentation.

Use of the names:
- “OpenMarkdown Theme”
- “Official OpenMarkdown Theme”
- “OpenMarkdown default style”

is permitted ONLY if:

- The OpenMarkdown specification is implemented correctly for the declared version, AND
- The unmodified OpenMarkdown default theme is used.

Forks, derivatives, or implementations that modify, replace, or extend
the default theme MUST NOT represent themselves as using the
OpenMarkdown theme or official OpenMarkdown styling.

Acceptable phrasing:
- “OpenMarkdown-compatible (custom theme)”
- “Based on OpenMarkdown, with custom styling”

Unacceptable phrasing:
- “OpenMarkdown Theme (modified)”
- “Official OpenMarkdown Style”
- “OpenMarkdown look” (when the default theme is not used)


## 6. Relationship to the MIT License

The OpenMarkdown reference implementation and default theme are licensed
under the MIT License.

This policy does NOT restrict:
- Use or modification of the source code
- Modification or reuse of the theme
- Reimplementation of the specification
- Commercial use

It applies ONLY to:
- Use of the name “OpenMarkdown”
- Claims of compatibility or official status
- Claims regarding the OpenMarkdown theme or visual identity
